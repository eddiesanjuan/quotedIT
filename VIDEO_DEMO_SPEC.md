## Video Structure

### Scene 1: The Pain (0:00 - 0:08)
**Visual:** Split screen or quick cuts showing the OLD way
- Person on job site, client asks "So what's this gonna cost?"
- Cut to: that person later, laptop open, spreadsheet, calculator, frustrated
- Text overlay: "30 minutes later..."
- They finally send a quote. Client already hired someone else.

**Audio/VO Option:**
"Every quote you don't send fast is a job you might lose."

**Purpose:** Immediate recognition of the pain. Gets attention.

---

### Scene 2: Meet Quoted (0:08 - 0:12)
**Visual:** Clean transition to Quoted logo/app
- Simple: "There's a better way."
- Quoted logo animates in
- Tagline: "Voice to quote in seconds. AI that learns your pricing."

**Purpose:** Brand moment. Quick, confident.

---

### Scene 3: Quick Setup / Interview (0:12 - 0:25)
**Visual:** Show the onboarding interview - FAST
- 3-4 questions appearing and being answered quickly
- "What kind of work do you do?" → [typing: "home repairs, painting, odd jobs"]
- "How do you typically charge?" → [selecting: "by the job"]
- "What's your hourly labor rate?" → [typing: "$65"]
- Progress bar filling up
- "Your pricing brain is ready."

**Key messaging:**
- This takes 2 minutes, not 2 hours
- You're teaching the AI YOUR way of pricing
- Not generic - personalized from the start

**Purpose:** Set expectation that there's a quick setup, but it's worth it.

### Scene 4: The Magic - Creating a Quote (0:25 - 0:45)
**Visual:** The core product experience

**4a. Voice Input (0:25 - 0:32)**

- Voice waveform animating as text appears:
  "Bathroom remodel for Sarah Chen. Replace vanity, new faucet, paint walls, about 6 hours of work."
- Text populates in real-time, feels magical

**4b. Quote Generation (0:32 - 0:38)**
- Loading shimmer (brief, 1-2 seconds)
- Quote card appears with line items:
  - Labor: 6 hours @ $65 = $390
  - Vanity replacement: $280
  - Faucet installation: $150
  - Paint (bathroom): $180
  - **Total: $1,000**
- Each line animates in, satisfying motion

### Scene 5: The Learning System (0:45 - 0:55)
**Visual:** What makes Quoted different

- Quote appears with a price
- User taps to edit: changes $150 → $200
- Small toast/notification: "✓ Learned! Future faucet jobs will be more accurate."
- Quick montage: 3-4 corrections happening
- Counter: "15 pricing rules learned"
- New quote comes in, prices are already right
- Text: "The more you use it, the smarter it gets."

**Key messaging:**
- Not static pricing - it learns YOUR patterns
- Gets better over time
- After 20-30 quotes, it knows your pricing better than you do

**Purpose:** Differentiation. This is the moat. No other tool does this.

**Visual:** Quick montage of CRM/business features

**6a. Customer Management (0:55 - 1:00)**

## Visual Style Guide

### Color Palette
- Primary: Quoted brand colors (dark navy + accent)
- Clean whites/light grays for backgrounds
- Accent color for CTAs and highlights
- Avoid: Overly bright, startup-cliche gradients

### Typography
- Modern sans-serif (Inter, SF Pro, or similar)
- Headlines: Bold, confident
- Body: Clean, readable
- Avoid: Playful/quirky fonts that undermine professionalism

### Motion Principles
- **Snappy:** Quick transitions, nothing lingers too long
- **Purposeful:** Every animation means something
- **Satisfying:** Micro-interactions that feel good (checkmarks, sliding cards)
- **Mobile-first:** Portrait-friendly compositions, thumb-zone awareness

### Iconography
- Simple line icons or filled minimal icons
- Consistent stroke weight
- Avoid: Overly detailed, skeuomorphic, or clip-art feeling

### Screen Mockups
- Show on device frames (iPhone, clean laptop)
- Use realistic but not cluttered UI
- Can be slightly stylized/simplified from actual app
- Dark mode or light mode - pick one and stay consistent

## Audio Options

### Option A: Music Only (Recommended for social/ads)
- Upbeat but not cheesy
- Modern, clean production
- Builds to the CTA
- No vocals in track (distracting)
- ~100-120 BPM

### Option B: Voiceover + Music
- Conversational tone, not announcer voice
- Male or female - should feel like a peer, not a salesperson
- Short sentences, punchy
- Music lower in mix, supporting role

### Option C: Sound Design Only
- UI sounds, subtle whooshes
- More minimal, premium feel
- Harder to pull off, but can be very effective

**Recommendation:** Start with music only. Easier to produce, works internationally, less to go wrong. Can add VO later if needed.

---

## Deliverables Needed

1. **Hero version (75-90 sec)** - Full demo for website/YouTube
2. **Social cuts:**
   - 60-sec version (Instagram/Facebook)
   - 30-sec version (ads, TikTok)
   - 15-sec version (stories, pre-roll)
3. **Aspect ratios:**
   - 16:9 (YouTube, website)
   - 9:16 (TikTok, Reels, Stories)
   - 1:1 (Instagram feed, LinkedIn)
4. **With and without CTA end cards** (for flexibility)
5. **Source files** (After Effects or similar) for future edits

---

## Production Notes

### What to provide to the creator:
1. This spec document
2. Brand assets (logo, colors, fonts)
3. Current app screenshots or Figma files
4. 2-3 reference videos you like
5. Any specific messaging/taglines to include
6. Feedback on first draft within 48 hours

### What to ask for in proposals:
1. Portfolio of similar SaaS/product videos
2. Their process (storyboard → animatic → final)
3. Number of revision rounds included
4. Timeline (expect 2-4 weeks for quality work)
5. What they need from you

### Red flags to avoid:
- No SaaS/tech experience in portfolio
- Only corporate/explainer video work
- Can't show motion design (just static graphics)
- No clear revision process
- Unusually cheap ($500 for this scope = will look cheap)

## Budget Guidance

| Option | Quality | Cost Range | Timeline |
|--------|---------|------------|----------|
| Premium agency (Sandwich, Demo Duck) | Exceptional | $10K-25K | 4-6 weeks |
| Boutique motion studio | Excellent | $5K-10K | 3-4 weeks |
| Senior freelancer (Dribbble/Behance) | Great | $2K-5K | 2-4 weeks |
| Mid-level freelancer (Upwork top-rated) | Good | $1K-2.5K | 2-3 weeks |
| Template-based + customization | Acceptable | $200-800 | 1-2 weeks |

**Recommendation for Quoted's stage:** Senior freelancer ($2-4K range). Best balance of quality, cost, and speed. Find someone whose portfolio already has the style you want.

## Open Questions

- [ ] Do we want voiceover or music-only?
- [ ] What specific examples should we show? (bathroom remodel, photography session, consulting project?)
- [ ] Do we have testimonials/social proof to include?
- [ ] Budget range to target?
- [ ] Timeline - when do we need this?
- [ ] Who should we show as the "user"? (hands only, illustrated character, real person?)
