## Channel Strategy

### Segment A Channels
| Channel | Effectiveness | Effort | CAC |
|---------|---------------|--------|-----|
| LinkedIn | Medium | High | $50-80 |
| Industry associations | High | Very High | $40-60 |
| Cold email | Low | Medium | $80-100 |
| Referrals | Medium | Low | $30-50 |

### Segment B Channels
| Channel | Effectiveness | Effort | CAC |
|---------|---------------|--------|-----|
| Facebook groups | Very High | Low | $15-25 |
| Local networks | Very High | Low | $10-20 |
| NextDoor | High | Medium | $20-30 |
| Referrals | Very High | Very Low | $10-15 |

## Activation Analysis

### Aha Moment by Segment
| Segment | Aha Moment | Quotes to Reach | Complexity |
|---------|------------|-----------------|------------|
| A | "Filtered a tire-kicker in 30 seconds" | 5-7 | High (needs bad lead) |
| B | "Quoted that in 30 seconds" | 1-2 | Low (instant) |

**Key insight**: Segment B activates 3-5x faster with simpler value realization.

### Onboarding Implications
- **Segment B**: Simple → "Record job, get quote, done"
- **Segment A**: Complex → "Use for qualification, then build detailed quote"
- **Recommendation**: Lead with Segment B simplicity in onboarding

---

## Retention Dynamics

### Segment A
- **Pattern**: Sporadic (when new leads come in)
- **Risk**: "Nice to have" vs essential
- **Churn triggers**: Seasonal slowdown, competing tools
- **30-day retention estimate**: 60-70%

### Segment B
- **Pattern**: Daily habit (every job inquiry)
- **Risk**: Low (mission-critical)
- **Churn triggers**: Accuracy failures only
- **30-day retention estimate**: 75-85%

**Key insight**: Daily usage = habit formation = retention. Segment B wins.

---

## Viral/Referral Analysis

### Segment A
- **Referral rate**: 0.3-0.5 per user
- **Why lower**: Fewer peers, requires explaining qualification concept
- **Referral timing**: Slow (monthly networking)

### Segment B
- **Referral rate**: 0.7-1.2 per user
- **Why higher**: Tight communities, simple to explain
- **Referral timing**: Fast (daily job site interactions)
- **Viral potential**: >1.0 coefficient possible (self-sustaining)

**Key insight**: Segment B could achieve viral growth without paid acquisition.

## Beta Strategy (Decided)

### Phase 1 (Week 1-2): 100% Segment B
- Target: Solo handyman, painters, flooring, small repairs
- Acquisition: Eddie's network (warm intros)
- Goal: Validate activation + retention

### Phase 2 (Week 3-4): 80% B / 20% A
- Add: 3-5 larger contractors (remodelers)
- Goal: See if qualification use case emerges organically

### Phase 3 (Week 5-6): Evaluate
- If Segment A shows strong patterns → Create separate landing page
- If not → Double down on Segment B

## Risks Identified

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Dual messaging dilutes both segments | Single-segment beta (B only) |
| Facebook groups ban promotion | Value-first engagement, organic sharing |
| Segment B doesn't correct quotes (learning unused) | Track correction rate, adjust messaging |
| Segment A has higher LTV but unreachable | Focus on B, add A post-PMF |

---

## Quick Wins Identified

### Immediate
- [x] Rewrite landing page for Segment B
- [x] Update beta emails with qualification value prop
- [ ] Target Facebook groups (search "how do you quote fast")
- [ ] Prep Eddie's network outreach (5-10 Type B contractors)

### Short-term (Post-Launch)
- [ ] Create referral templates for easy sharing
- [ ] Track usage patterns (qualification vs final quote)
- [ ] Survey beta users on use case
- [ ] Measure viral coefficient

- [ ] 30-day retention by segment
- [ ] Referral rate by segment
- [ ] Which channels convert best
- [ ] Do any Segment A use cases emerge organically?
