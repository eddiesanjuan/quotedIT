### Secondary: Small Contractor
- 4-10 employees
- Has existing pricing system (Type A)
- Pain point: Training estimators to price consistently

## Key Messages That Work

| Message | Why It Works | Use Where |
|---------|--------------|-----------|
| "Speak the job, send the bid" | Action-oriented, implies speed | Headlines |
| "Ballpark quotes, not blueprints" | Sets realistic expectations | Features |
| "Learns your pricing over time" | Differentiation from static tools | Value prop |
| "30-second quotes vs 30-minute spreadsheets" | Concrete time comparison | Social proof |
| "Win more jobs with faster quotes" | Outcome-focused | CTAs |

## Messages to Avoid

| Don't Say | Why | Say Instead |
|-----------|-----|-------------|
| "AI-powered estimation" | Generic, doesn't explain benefit | "Voice quotes in 30 seconds" |
| "Revolutionary" | Overused, skepticism trigger | "Simple" or "fast" |
| "Transform your business" | Too salesy | "Win more jobs" |
| "Cutting-edge technology" | Contractors don't care | "Works on any phone" |

## Channel Insights

### Facebook Groups
- Contractor groups are active and skeptical
- Success: Share value first (tips, templates)
- Failure: Direct promotion gets banned/ignored
- Best: Get member to share experience organically

### Email
- Subject lines: Numbers and specifics work ("3 quotes in 2 minutes")
- Length: Short (under 150 words)
- CTA: Single, clear action

### Word of Mouth
- Contractor communities are tight-knit
- One happy user = 5-10 referrals
- Bad experience spreads faster than good
