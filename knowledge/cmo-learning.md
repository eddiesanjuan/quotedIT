## Positioning Decisions

| Date | Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|------|----------|-----------|---------|
| 2025-12-02 | Lead with qualification value prop | Reframes quoting as lead filtering, not estimation | Landing page updated |
| 2025-12-02 | "Qualify faster. Close more." approved | Outcome-focused, rhymes, memorable | Primary tagline |
| 2025-12-02 | Defer ballpark-only segment messaging | Needs beta validation before committing | Removed from landing |
| 2025-12-02 | Reject "only tool you need" | Sounds LIMITED, not focused | Not implemented |

## Tagline Rankings (From Audit)

| Rank | Tagline | Score | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|-------|
| 1 | "Stop quoting. Start qualifying." | 9/10 | Clear, action-oriented, reframes problem |
| 2 | "Qualify faster. Close more." | 8/10 | Outcome-focused, simple, rhymes |
| 3 | "Close enough to close the deal." | 7/10 | Clever wordplay, but doesn't translate in noisy channels |
| 4 | "Ballpark it. Bill it. Done." | 6/10 | Only works for 40% of market |
| 5 | "The only quoting tool some jobs need." | 5/10 | WEAK - sounds limited |

## Key Messaging Insights

### What Works
- **Qualification framing**: "Stop wasting time on tire-kickers" resonates deeply
- **Time comparison**: "30 minutes with spreadsheets vs 2 minutes" is concrete
- **Learning system**: "Gets smarter with every correction" differentiates from static tools
- **Gut feeling**: "Your gut feeling, systematized" respects contractor expertise

### What Doesn't Work
- **"AI-powered"**: Generic, doesn't explain benefit
- **"Revolutionary"**: Overused, triggers skepticism
- **"For some jobs"**: Makes product sound limited
- **"Close enough"**: May undervalue the product (implies rough/unprofessional)

## Segment Messaging Strategy

### Segment A (Qualification-focused)
- **Lead with**: "Stop quoting. Start qualifying."
- **Pain point**: Wasted time on unqualified leads
- **Value prop**: Filter tire-kickers in under 2 minutes
- **CTA**: "See if they're serious before you invest hours"

### Segment B (Ballpark-only)
- **Status**: DEFERRED - Validate in beta first
- **Risk**: Dual messaging dilutes both segments
- **If validated**: Create separate landing page, don't mix with Segment A

## Competitive Positioning

### Category We're Creating
"Instant voice qualification from job site" - UNCLAIMED

### Versus Competitors
| Competitor | Their Position | Our Counter |
|------------|---------------|-------------|
| Buildxact | Detailed estimation | "We qualify, they estimate" |
| Jobber | Full CRM | "We win the job, they run the business" |
| Spreadsheets | Familiar | "10x faster, learns your pricing" |

### Moat Assessment (Current)
- **Strength**: 6/10
- **Voice + learning**: Defensible 12-18 months
- **Category creation**: Buys 6-12 months
- **To strengthen**: Get 1,000+ users (data moat), build integrations (switching cost)

## Concerns to Monitor

1. **"Qualification" implies needing second tool** - Track if users send quotes as-is or build detailed proposals after
2. **"Ballpark" may sound unprofessional** - Watch for customer acceptance data
3. **Dual positioning risk** - Don't try to be all things in hero message
