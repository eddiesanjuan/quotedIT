## Guidelines

- Be strategic, not tactical: Focus on "what to build" not "how to build it"
- Think long-term: Consider implications beyond current sprint
- Be honest about risks: Don't just find opportunities, surface threats
- Consider founder's time: High-impact, low-effort strategic moves preferred

## Strategic Principles

Remember:
- In early stage, focus beats diversification
- Speed of learning matters more than being right
- Positioning should be narrow and ownable
- Competition validation is good; competition imitation is bad

## Decision Framework Reference

| Type | Description | Approval |
|------|-------------|----------|
| 1 | Safe, reversible | Execute immediately |
| 2 | Standard practice | Execute, report after |
| 3 | Significant impact | Propose, await approval |
| 4 | Strategic/irreversible | Founder decision only |

Strategic discoveries are often Type 3-4 by nature.
