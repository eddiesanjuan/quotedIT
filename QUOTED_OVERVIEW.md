# Quoted — Voice to Quote for Contractors

**Turn voice notes into professional quotes in seconds.**

---

## The Problem

Contractors lose hours every week creating quotes. They know their pricing cold, but typing it up takes time they don't have. Many send sloppy texts or forget to follow up entirely—leaving money on the table.

## The Solution

Quoted lets contractors speak naturally about a job and get a professional budgetary quote back instantly.

```
"16 by 20 composite deck, Trex Select. Demo the old one.
 Standard aluminum railing, about 50 feet. Customer is
 John Smith at 123 Oak Street."
```

**30 seconds later:** A professional PDF quote for $18,500 lands in their inbox, ready to send.

## How It Works

### 1. Onboarding (One Time)
Claude interviews the contractor to learn their specific pricing:
- Labor rates ($85/hr owner, $50/hr helper)
- Material rates ($60/sqft composite, $45/lf railing)
- Special rules ("Add 10% in the Heights neighborhood")
- Terms (50% deposit, 2-year warranty)

### 2. Daily Use
- Contractor records a voice note describing the job
- AI transcribes and synthesizes using *their* pricing model
- Returns structured quote with line items, timeline, and questions to clarify

### 3. Learning Loop
When the contractor edits a quote, the system learns:
- "Ah, he always adds $200 for stairs"
- "She charges more for second-story demo"
- Accuracy improves with every correction

## Per-Contractor Data Isolation

Each contractor's pricing model is completely separate:

| Contractor A | Contractor B |
|-------------|-------------|
| Composite: $60/sqft | Composite: $48/sqft |
| Railing: $45/lf | Railing: $35/lf |
| Heights: +10% | No surcharges |
| Deposit: 50% | Deposit: 30% |

Same job description → Different quotes → Both correct for *their* business.

## The Moat

After 50+ quotes, Quoted knows YOUR pricing deeply:
- Your specific rates and markups
- Your terminology and job patterns
- Your adjustment rules and exceptions
- Your customer history

**Switching means starting over.** The learning is the lock-in.

## What It's Not

- **Not a detailed takeoff** — Budgetary estimates only
- **Not a contract** — Quick pricing guidance, not binding proposals
- **Not wizard-of-oz** — Real AI, no humans behind the curtain
