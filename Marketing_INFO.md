**Last Updated**: 2025-12-21
**Status**: EXECUTION READY

# PART 1: EDDIE'S 15-MINUTE LAUNCH PLAN

**Everything below is copy-paste ready. No thinking required.**

## THE CHECKLIST

| # | Action | Time | Platform | Done? |
|---|--------|------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Send 5 texts to contractor friends | 3 min | iMessage/SMS | [ ] |
| 2 | Post Reddit thread | 4 min | r/contractors | [ ] |
| 3 | Post Twitter thread | 3 min | @QuotedIT_app | [ ] |
| 4 | Post LinkedIn update | 3 min | Your profile | [ ] |
| 5 | Check responses (later today) | 2 min | All platforms | [ ] |

**Total**: ~15 minutes of actual work

---

## STEP 1: TEXT YOUR NETWORK (3 min)

**Send to 5-10 contractor contacts you know personally.**

This is your highest-conversion channel. Personal > everything.

### Copy-Paste Text Message:

```
Hey! Quick favor - I built an app for contractors that turns voice notes into professional quotes in about 60 seconds. AI learns your pricing over time.

Would love your honest feedback if you have 5 min to try it: https://quoted.it.com/demo?utm_source=personal&utm_campaign=launch

No pressure at all, just looking for early users to help shape this thing.
```

### Shorter Version (if you prefer):

```
Hey - built a voice-to-quote app for contractors. 60 seconds to a professional PDF quote. Would love your take on it: https://quoted.it.com/demo?utm_source=personal&utm_campaign=launch
```

**Send to**: Anyone you know who quotes jobs (painters, electricians, plumbers, GCs, handymen, landscapers, etc.)

---

## STEP 2: REDDIT POST (4 min)

**Where**: r/contractors (72K members, active community)
**When**: Best time is Tuesday-Thursday, 9-11am EST (but post whenever you're ready)

### Post Title:

```
I got tired of spending 30 minutes on quotes from my truck, so I built a voice-to-quote app
```

### Post Body (copy this exactly):

```
For years I watched contractors (including friends and family) struggle with the same thing: you're on a job site, customer asks for a quote, and now you're either:

1. Promising to "send something over tonight" (which means paperwork at 9pm)
2. Scribbling on a notepad and hoping you remember your markup
3. Texting a number that you'll inevitably lowball or forget materials on

So I built something. You describe the job out loud - "two coats on 1200 square feet, need to prime, customer wants semi-gloss" - and it generates a professional PDF quote in about 60 seconds.

The AI learns YOUR pricing. First few quotes you might need to correct it, but it gets smarter with every job. After 10-15 quotes, it knows your rates better than your spreadsheet does.

$9/month. No contracts, no BS tiers, cancel anytime.

I'm looking for contractors to try it and tell me what sucks about it. Genuinely want feedback - this is built FOR contractors, so if something's broken or annoying, I need to know.

Demo (no signup needed): https://quoted.it.com/demo?utm_source=reddit&utm_campaign=contractors

Happy to answer any questions. And if you think this is dumb, tell me that too - I'd rather know now than find out after I've sunk another year into it.
```

### Backup Subreddits (post to ONE per day max):

- r/Construction (171K) - same post works
- r/smallbusiness (1.8M) - adjust angle to "small business owner built..."
- r/HVAC (117K) - if you want HVAC-specific
- r/electricians (235K) - if targeting electricians

**DO NOT** spam multiple subreddits the same day. One post, engage with comments, wait 2-3 days before posting elsewhere.

---

## STEP 3: TWITTER THREAD (3 min)

**Account**: @QuotedIT_app (or your personal if you prefer founder angle)

### Thread (post as individual tweets):

**Tweet 1:**
```
I built an app that turns voice notes into professional quotes in 60 seconds.

For contractors who are tired of doing paperwork at 9pm.

Here's the 30-second demo: https://quoted.it.com/demo?utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=launch
```

**Tweet 2 (reply to yourself):**
```
How it works:

1. Describe the job out loud ("two coats on 1200 sqft, need primer, semi-gloss")
2. AI generates itemized quote with YOUR pricing
3. Download PDF, send to customer

The AI learns from every correction. Gets smarter over time.
```

**Tweet 3 (reply to tweet 2):**
```
$9/month. No tiers, no contracts.

Looking for early users to help shape this thing.

If you're a contractor (or know one) - would love your feedback on what sucks about it.
```

### Standalone Tweet Option (if you don't want a thread):

```
Built an app for contractors:

- Describe job by voice
- AI generates professional quote in 60 seconds
- Learns YOUR pricing over time

$9/mo. No BS.

Looking for early users: https://quoted.it.com/demo?utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=launch

What would make this actually useful for you?
```

---

## STEP 4: LINKEDIN POST (3 min)

### Post (copy this exactly):

```
I built something.

For years I've watched contractors struggle with quotes. They're on a job site, customer asks for a price, and now they're either promising to "send something tonight" (9pm paperwork) or scribbling numbers on a notepad.

So I built Quoted - a voice-to-quote app for contractors.

Describe the job out loud. Get a professional PDF quote in 60 seconds. The AI learns your pricing over time.

$9/month. No enterprise tiers. No annual contracts.

I'm looking for contractors to try it and tell me what's broken. This is built for the solo contractor and 2-3 person crew, not the company with a full-time estimator.

If you know any contractors who might find this useful, I'd appreciate an intro.

Demo: https://quoted.it.com/demo?utm_source=linkedin&utm_campaign=launch

```

## STEP 5: RESPOND TO ENGAGEMENT (later)

When people respond:

### For Positive Comments:
```
Thanks! Would love to hear how it goes if you try it. DM me if anything's confusing or broken - I fix stuff same-day.
```

### For Skeptical Comments:
```
Fair point. The accuracy comes from the learning system - first few quotes need corrections, but it gets significantly better after 10-15 jobs. Happy to jump on a quick call if you want to see it in action.
```

### For Feature Requests:
```
That's a great idea - adding it to the list. What would be the ideal way for that to work for you?
```

### For "How's it different from X" Questions:
```
Main difference is voice-first (designed for job sites, not desks) and the learning system - it adapts to YOUR pricing with every correction instead of using generic templates.
```

## MESSAGING CHEAT SHEET

**One-liner**: "Voice-to-quote in 60 seconds for contractors"

**Value props** (use in conversations):
1. "Describe the job, get a professional PDF quote"
2. "AI learns YOUR pricing over time"
3. "$9/month, no contracts"
4. "Built for job sites, not desks"

**Objection handlers**:
- "How accurate is it?" → "First few quotes need corrections, but it learns. After 10-15 jobs, it knows your rates."
- "What about complex jobs?" → "It asks clarifying questions when it's not sure. You can always edit before sending."
- "I already use X" → "Fair - Quoted is specifically for voice-first quoting from job sites. If you're already happy, stick with what works."

# PART 2: STRATEGIC DISTRIBUTION FRAMEWORK

*(This is the "why" behind the execution above)*

---

## Who Could Quoted Actually Help?

Anyone who quotes work and struggles with:
- Not knowing what to charge
- Quoting taking too long
- Looking unprofessional (handwritten/texted quotes)
- Forgetting to bill for things
- Undercharging

That's:
- Freelancers (designers, writers, developers, consultants)
- Handymen
- Photographers
- Event planners / caterers / DJs
- Cleaning services
- Personal trainers / coaches
- Landscapers / lawn care
- Painters
- Movers
- Pet sitters / dog walkers
- Tutors
- Pool service
- Pressure washing
- Mobile detailing
- Any service business that quotes jobs

The common thread isn't the trade - it's "I quote work and wish it was easier/faster/more confident."

---

## Distribution Strategies (Trade-Agnostic)

### 1. Be Findable When They're Looking

**Pain-point SEO/SEM:**
- "how to price [service]"
- "quote template for [industry]"
- "how much to charge for [job]"
- "freelance pricing calculator"

These searches happen across ALL the audiences above. Someone googling "how much should I charge for photography" and someone googling "handyman pricing guide" have the same underlying need.

**Directories / Marketplaces:**
- Product Hunt launch
- Capterra / G2 listings
- "Alternative to [competitor]" sites
- App store if you build mobile

### 2. Be Tryable With Zero Friction

The demo is your best distribution asset.

People can try it without signing up. That's rare. Lean into it:
- Every link goes to demo first, not signup
- "Try it now, no account needed"
- 30 seconds to value

**Embeddable quote widget:**
- Let people embed a "Get a Quote" button on their own sites
- Their customers use it → they see the value → they sign up
- Distribution via usage

### 3. Be Visible Where They Spend Time

**Short-form video (cross-platform):**
One video works everywhere - TikTok, Reels, YouTube Shorts, LinkedIn.

Not "Quoted is great!" but just showing it:
- "Quoting a job from my truck in 30 seconds"
- "POV: client asks for a quote and you send it before they finish the sentence"
- "The difference between how I used to quote vs now"

These work for any audience - the visual of fast quoting is universally compelling.

**Content that actually helps:**
- "The Complete Guide to Pricing Your Services"
- "5 Things You Forget to Bill For (And How It Costs You)"
- "How to Quote a Job When You Have No Idea What to Charge"
- "What to Say When Clients Say You're Too Expensive"

These attract people with the exact problem Quoted solves. Honest because the content is valuable even if they never sign up.

### 4. Be Recommendable by People They Trust

**Partnerships:**
- Bookkeeping tools (QuickBooks, Wave, FreshBooks) - their users need to quote before they invoice
- CRMs (HubSpot, Pipedrive) - quoting is part of sales
- Freelancer platforms (Upwork, Fiverr alumni groups)
- Small business associations, Chamber of Commerce
- Trade associations (not just contractors - wedding industry, event industry, creative industry)

**Podcasts / YouTube channels:**
- Business podcasts for freelancers
- Side hustle content
- Small business advice channels
- These exist for every niche

**Influencers in niches:**
- Photography business YouTubers
- Freelance designer Twitterers
- Cleaning business TikTokers
- They all talk about pricing pain

### 5. Be Spreadable by Users

**Referral mechanics:**
- Free month for referrer + referee
- Make it worth sharing
- Contractors know contractors, freelancers know freelancers

**The PDF itself is marketing:**
- Every quote sent shows the customer "Powered by Quoted" or similar
- If the quote looks professional, they ask "how'd you make this?"
- Distribution through usage

**Shareable demo results:**
- "Share this quote" button
- Screenshot-friendly output
- People share things that make them look good

### 6. Be Discoverable Through Events

**Online:**
- Virtual summits for freelancers
- Webinars with partners
- Twitter Spaces / LinkedIn Lives on pricing topics

**Offline:**
- Small business meetups
- Freelancer coworking events
- Niche trade shows (wedding expos, creative conferences, etc.)

## The Highest-Leverage Plays

If I had to pick the five things most likely to get Quoted into hands that need it:

| Strategy | Why It Works | Effort |
|----------|--------------|--------|
| Pain-point Google Ads | People actively searching for help | Medium |
| 30-second demo videos | Show value instantly, works everywhere | Low |
| Product Hunt launch | One-time, high visibility, early adopters spread | Low |
| "Powered by Quoted" on PDFs | Every quote sent = distribution | Already done? |
| Referral program | Users who love it recruit for you | Medium |

---

## The Honest Distribution Playbook

1. **Make finding you easy** - Be where people search for pricing help
2. **Make trying you instant** - Demo with no signup is rare and powerful
3. **Make the value obvious** - 30 seconds to understand = shareable
4. **Make sharing rewarding** - Referral incentives, social proof
5. **Make the product speak** - Every quote sent is an ad for Quoted

None of this requires pretending you're not selling something. You're just making a useful thing discoverable and tryable.
