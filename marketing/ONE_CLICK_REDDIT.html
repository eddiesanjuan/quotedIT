I run a $30-50M contracting business. After years of watching my team struggle with quoting tools that are either way too complex (Buildxact, Jobber) or way too basic (Excel spreadsheets), I built something in between.

It learns your pricing over time. No 47-tab setup wizards. No enterprise sales calls.

$9/mo. Built it for contractors like the ones I work with every day.

**Name**: Quoted

**Pitch**: Voice-to-quote for contractors

**My background**: I operate a $30-50M contracting business. Built this because every quoting tool I tried was either designed for enterprise (Buildxact) or was just a glorified spreadsheet.

**The gap I saw**: Contractors making $50-500K/year need professional quotes but don't need (or want) complex software. They want to describe a job and get a PDF.

**Looking for feedback on**:
- Demo flow at /demo (try without signup)
- Is $9/mo positioned right for this market?
- Landing page - does it speak to blue-collar users?

**Stage**: Just launched, first users in trial, bootstrapped

Not a success story. Just sharing what I'm building and why.

**Background**: I operate a contracting business that does $30-50M annually. I've used every quoting tool out there - Jobber, Housecall Pro, Buildxact, ServiceTitan. They all have the same problem:

They're either built for enterprise (complex setup, features you'll never use, sales calls to get pricing) or they're basically spreadsheets with a logo.

**The gap I kept seeing**:

The solo contractor or small crew doing $50K-$500K/year. They need to look professional to win jobs, but they don't need a $200/mo platform with CRM, scheduling, invoicing, dispatch, and 47 other features.

They need to describe a job and get a PDF. That's it.

**What I built**:

Quoted.it.com - speak your estimate out loud (like you would to a helper), and AI generates a professional PDF quote.

- Learns your pricing over time
- No complex setup
- $9/mo flat

**Where I'm at**:
- First users in trial
- Solo on the product side, still running my main business
- Just launched a demo where you can try it without signup

**What I've learned so far**:

1. Contractors don't want "AI" - they want less time doing paperwork
2. The "learning" feature (AI remembers your prices) resonates way more than I expected
3. Blue-collar users are skeptical of software. The demo-before-signup approach helps.
