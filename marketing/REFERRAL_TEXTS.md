## Tips

1. **Personalize the name** - Don't send "[Name]", actually put their name
2. **Reference something specific** - "I know you're always quoting from the truck" works better than generic
3. **Don't be salesy** - You're sharing something useful, not pitching
4. **Demo link is key** - quoted.it.com/demo lets them try without commitment
5. **One follow-up max** - If they don't respond twice, let it go
