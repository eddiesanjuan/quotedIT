## Email Templates (Copy into Apollo)

### Email 1: Day 0 - Operator Credibility

**Subject**: `Built this after running a $30M+ contracting business`

```
Hey {{first_name}},

I run a $30-50M contracting business. After years of watching my team struggle with quoting tools that are either way too complex or way too basic, I built something in between.

Quoted.it.com - speak your estimate out loud, get a professional PDF in 60 seconds.

It learns your pricing over time. No enterprise setup. No sales calls.

30-second demo: https://quoted.it.com/demo?utm_source=email&utm_medium=cold&utm_campaign=apollo_v1

If you're tired of typing quotes on your phone or paying for software you don't fully use, this might help.

Quoted.it.com

P.S. $9/mo. No contracts.

### Email 2: Day 3 - Quick Follow-Up

**Subject**: `Re: Built this after running a $30M+ contracting business`

```
Hey {{first_name}},

Just bumping this - did you get a chance to check the demo?

If quotes aren't a pain point for you, no worries at all. Happy to take you off my list.

### Email 3: Day 7 - Peer-to-Peer

**Subject**: `One operator to another`

```
Hey {{first_name}},

I run a $30-50M contracting business. I know how painful the quoting process can be.

Built a tool that lets you speak your estimate and get a professional PDF instantly. Learns your pricing. $9/mo.

Not trying to sell you enterprise software. Just something simple that works.

quoted.it.com/demo if you want to try it.

### Email 4: Day 14 - Break-Up

**Subject**: `Closing the loop`

```
Hey {{first_name}},

I've reached out a couple times about the quote tool - totally understand if it's not for you.

If you ever want to check it out, the demo's always at quoted.it.com/demo.

Wishing you a busy season!

|------|-------------|-------------|--------------|-------|--------|
| 1 | 100 | 30 | 3 | 2 | 1 |
| 2 | 100 | 30 | 3 | 2 | 1 |

## Alternative Tools (If Not Apollo)

| Tool | Price | Pros | Cons |
|------|-------|------|------|
| **Apollo** | $49/mo | All-in-one, has contacts DB | Learning curve |
| **Instantly** | $37/mo | Great deliverability | No contact DB |
| **Lemlist** | $59/mo | Good personalization | Expensive |
| **Smartlead** | $39/mo | Unlimited emails | Newer tool |

**If using Instantly/Lemlist/Smartlead**: You'll need to find emails separately using:
- Hunter.io ($49/mo)
- Snov.io ($39/mo)
- Or manually via Google Maps

**Apollo is laziest because it's all-in-one.**

## Troubleshooting

### Low Open Rates (<20%)
- Check spam score at mail-tester.com
- Ensure warmup is running
- Try different subject lines

### Low Reply Rates (<2%)
- Your targeting may be off
- Try different industries/company sizes
- A/B test email copy

### Getting Marked as Spam
- Slow down sending (max 50/day per mailbox)
- Add more warmup time
- Remove bounced emails immediately

---

- [ ] Create sequence with 4 emails
- [ ] Build first search (plumbers in your city)
