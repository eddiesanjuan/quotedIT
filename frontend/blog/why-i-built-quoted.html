    <article class="article-content">
        <p>Here's the problem I kept seeing: people who quote things for a living spend an absurd amount of time on the quoting itself.</p>

        <p>Not the thinking. Not the expertise. The administrative overhead. The typing. The formatting. The CRM management. The follow-ups. All the stuff that surrounds the actual work of deciding what something should cost.</p>

        <p>A contractor who can look at a kitchen and know within seconds what a renovation should cost? That same person might spend 30 minutes typing it up into a quote. Then another 20 minutes logging it in their CRM. Then they forget to follow up because they're busy actually doing jobs.</p>

        <p>It's wasteful. And it's everywhere.</p>

        <h2>The Time Sink Nobody Talks About</h2>

        <p>Quoting and CRM work are like a tax on running a business. Everyone pays it. Nobody likes it. And most people just accept it as part of the deal.</p>

        <p>I started paying attention to how much time people actually spend on this stuff. It was staggering:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Small contractors</strong>: 5-10 hours a week writing quotes, often in the evenings</li>
            <li><strong>Freelancers and consultants</strong>: Hours crafting proposals that should take minutes</li>
            <li><strong>Service businesses</strong>: Staff dedicated entirely to quote management</li>
            <li><strong>Sales teams</strong>: CRM entry that adds 30% overhead to every customer interaction</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The tools that exist? They don't actually solve this. They just move the work around. You're still typing. You're still formatting. You're still manually entering data into systems designed for people who have assistants.</p>

        <p class="pullquote">Most quoting and CRM software doesn't save time—it just makes the time waste look more professional.</p>

        <h2>What AI and Voice Actually Enable</h2>

        <p>Two things changed recently that made me realize this problem was solvable.</p>

        <p><strong>First: AI got actually good.</strong> Not demo-good. Production-good. Good enough to understand context, learn from examples, and generate output that's genuinely useful without constant hand-holding.</p>

        <p><strong>Second: Voice transcription became seamless.</strong> You can talk to your phone and it just... works. Accurately. In real-time. Even with technical terminology.</p>

        <p>Put those together and you have something powerful: the ability to capture expertise at the speed of thought.</p>

        <div class="callout insight">
            <p class="callout-title">The opportunity</p>
            <p>What if you could describe a job out loud—walking through a customer's house, standing on a job site, driving between appointments—and have a professional quote ready before you finish talking?</p>
        </div>

        <p>That's not a small improvement. That's eliminating the bottleneck entirely.</p>

        <h2>Anyone Who Quotes Anything</h2>

        <p>This started with contractors because that's where I first saw the problem clearly. But the more I thought about it, the more I realized this applies to <strong>anyone who quotes things for a living</strong>.</p>

        <p>Wedding photographers. IT consultants. Home inspectors. Event planners. Landscapers. Personal trainers selling packages. Freelance designers. Moving companies. Cleaning services. Anyone who looks at a situation and puts a price on it.</p>

        <p>All of these people share the same problem: the quoting process takes way longer than the pricing decision. The expertise happens in seconds. The administrative work takes forever.</p>

        <p>Voice-to-quote collapses that gap. You already know what it should cost. Now the system can learn how you think about pricing, and generate the quote while you're still talking.</p>

        <h2>Sophisticated Pricing for Everyone</h2>

        <p>Here's something I realized that surprised me: a lot of people don't price things in a sophisticated way because they don't have the tools for it.</p>

        <p>Big companies have pricing analysts. They have CRM systems that track win rates by price point. They have data on what competitors charge. They refine their pricing constantly based on outcomes.</p>

        <p>Small operators? They pick a number that feels right and stick with it. Not because they're unsophisticated—because building a real pricing system takes time they don't have.</p>

        <p>What if AI could give everyone that capability?</p>

        <p>Imagine a system that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Learns your pricing patterns from the quotes you create</li>
            <li>Notices when you charge more for certain types of jobs</li>
            <li>Tracks which prices win and which don't</li>
            <li>Gets smarter over time without you doing anything extra</li>
        </ul>

        <p>That's what I set out to build. Not just faster quotes—smarter quotes. The kind of pricing intelligence that used to require a team, available to anyone with a phone.</p>

        <h2>How It Actually Works</h2>

        <p>The core idea is simple: you talk, the system learns, and over time it understands how you price things.</p>

        <p>Describe a bathroom remodel. The AI generates a quote based on what it knows about your pricing—materials you prefer, labor rates you charge, how you handle contingencies. The quote comes out formatted professionally, ready to send.</p>

        <p>Over time, the system notices patterns. This person charges more for second-floor work. They add a premium for older homes. They discount for repeat customers. All of this gets encoded without you ever having to articulate it explicitly.</p>

        <p><strong>The result: quotes that sound like you, generated in seconds instead of hours.</strong></p>

        <p>The AI isn't replacing your judgment. It's learning from it. You're still the expert. The system just makes your expertise accessible instantly, instead of locked behind 30 minutes of typing.</p>

        <h2>The Vision</h2>

        <p>I believe we're heading toward a world where administrative overhead approaches zero for people who do real work.</p>

        <p>The person who's best at tiling shouldn't have to choose between doing excellent work and running an organized business. The photographer who sees the perfect shot shouldn't be spending evenings on proposal documents. The consultant who gives great advice shouldn't be losing clients because their quote took three days.</p>

        <p>AI and voice make this possible. Not by replacing human expertise—by amplifying it. By removing the friction between knowing what something should cost and having a professional quote in front of the customer.</p>

        <p>That's why I built Quoted. Not because the world needed another quoting app. Because the world needed a way to eliminate the time sink that holds back anyone who prices things for a living.</p>

        <h2>Is This For You?</h2>

        <p>If you quote things for a living and you're happy with how long it takes—this probably isn't for you.</p>

        <p>But if you've ever thought "I know what this should cost, I just hate the paperwork"—then yeah, it might be worth five minutes of your time to try the demo.</p>

        <p>The system gets better the more you use it. The first quote might be 80% right. By the tenth, it sounds like you wrote it yourself. Because in a way, you did—the AI just learned how you think.</p>

        <p>Skeptical? Good. You should be skeptical of anyone promising AI magic. Try it and see. Worst case, you're out five minutes. Best case, you get your evenings back.</p>
