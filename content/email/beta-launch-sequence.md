## Email 1: Beta Invitation

**Subject Lines:**
1. I built something for you
2. Your next quote in 30 seconds
3. Voice-to-quote for contractors (beta invite)

**Send Timing:** Initial invitation

**Body:**

Hey [Name],

I've been building something for contractors who lose jobs to slow quotes.

It's called Quoted. You speak the job, it sends the bid. 30 seconds instead of 30 minutes.

Voice-to-quote from the job site. Learns your pricing over time. No spreadsheets.

You're one of 15 contractors I'm inviting to test it first. Your feedback shapes what we build.

Try it free for 7 days: https://quoted.it.com

75 quotes included in your trial.

## Email 2: Getting Started

**Subject Lines:**
1. Your first quote in 3 steps
2. How to use Quoted (quick start)
3. Welcome to Quoted

**Send Timing:** Day 1 after signup

**Body:**

Welcome to Quoted.

Here's how it works:

1. **Record the job** - Speak naturally. "Two-bedroom repaint, walls and trim, customer wants Sherwin Williams."
2. **Review the quote** - We generate line items with prices. Edit anything that's off.
3. **Send it** - PDF goes straight to your customer.

Start here: https://quoted.it.com

You've got 75 quotes in your trial.

**Pro tip**: The more detail you give, the better the quote. "20x12 kitchen" beats "kitchen remodel."

## Email 3: Mid-Trial Check-in

**Subject Lines:**
1. How's Quoted working for you?
2. Day 4 - quick check-in
3. Your trial ends in 3 days

**Send Timing:** Day 4 of trial

**Body:**

Quick check-in. How's Quoted working for you?

One thing I want you to know: **it gets smarter as you use it.**

Every time you edit a quote, the system learns. Your third bathroom remodel will be more accurate than your first.

You've got 3 days left in your trial.

**Help a contractor friend**: Refer someone who signs up and you both get +7 days free.

Hit reply if you have questions or feedback. I read every message.
