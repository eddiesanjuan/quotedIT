## Email 1: Beta Invitation

**Subject Lines:**
1. I built something for you
2. Stop wasting time on tire-kickers
3. Qualify faster. Close more.

**Send Timing:** Initial invitation

**Body:**

Hey [Name],

Stop wasting afternoons on people who were never going to buy.

I built Quoted for contractors who need to qualify leads fast. Voice the job details, get a ballpark in under 2 minutes.

If they're serious, build the detailed quote. If they flinch at the ballpark, you just saved an afternoon.

Gets smarter with every correction. Your gut feeling, systematized.

You're one of 15 contractors I'm inviting to test it first. Your feedback shapes what we build.

## Email 2: Getting Started

**Subject Lines:**
1. Qualify first, quote later
2. Your first quote in 3 steps
3. Welcome to Quoted

**Send Timing:** Day 1 after signup

**Body:**

Welcome to Quoted.

The workflow: qualify first, then decide if the job's worth your time.

1. **Voice the basics** - "Two-bedroom repaint, walls and trim, Sherwin Williams."
2. **Get your ballpark** - Under 2 minutes. Send it or keep it internal.
3. **Edit what's off** - System learns from your corrections.

Early-stage projects have fuzzy details. A ballpark shows if they're serious. Stop spending hours on unqualified leads.

Start here: https://quoted.it.com

**Pro tip**: More detail = better accuracy. "20x12 kitchen" beats "kitchen remodel."

**Body:**

Quick check-in. How's Quoted working for you?

One thing I want you to know: **it gets smarter with every correction.**

You've got 3 days left in your trial.
