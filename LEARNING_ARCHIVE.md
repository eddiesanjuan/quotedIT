# Learning Archive

> **Purpose**: Cold storage for aged-out patterns from LEARNING_MEMORY.md
> **Created**: 2026-01-05
> **Policy**: Patterns moved here when score reaches 0 or section limits exceeded

This archive preserves patterns that are no longer actively injected but may be useful for:
1. Historical analysis
2. Detecting recurring patterns
3. Auditing system decisions
4. Restoring patterns if they become relevant again

**To restore a pattern**: Copy it back to the appropriate section in LEARNING_MEMORY.md with score = 3 (LOW_VALUE).

## Archived Successful Patterns

> Patterns that decayed to score 0 or were displaced by newer, higher-scoring patterns.
