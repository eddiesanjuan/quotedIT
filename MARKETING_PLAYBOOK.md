## Positioning

**Core Message**: I run a $30-50M contracting business. After years of watching my team struggle with quoting tools that are either way too complex (enterprise) or way too basic (spreadsheets), I built something in between.

**Target Customer**: Solo contractors and small crews doing $50K-$500K/year who need professional quotes but don't need complex software.

**Differentiator**: Built by an operator who understands the trades, not a tech company trying to sell enterprise features.

## Reddit Posts (Ready to Use)

### Post 1: r/smallbusiness Weekly Promote Thread

```
I run a $30-50M contracting business. After years of watching my team struggle
with quoting tools that are either way too complex (Buildxact, Jobber) or way
too basic (Excel spreadsheets), I built something in between.

Quoted.it.com - speak your estimate out loud, get a professional PDF in 60 seconds.

It learns your pricing over time. No 47-tab setup wizards. No enterprise sales calls.

$9/mo. Built it for contractors like the ones I work with every day.

Happy to answer questions about either the tool or running a trades business.

### Post 2: r/SaaS Weekly Feedback Thread

```
**Name**: Quoted
**URL**: quoted.it.com
**Pitch**: Voice-to-quote for contractors

**My background**: I operate a $30-50M contracting business. Built this because
every quoting tool I tried was either designed for enterprise (Buildxact) or
was just a glorified spreadsheet.

**The gap I saw**: Contractors making $50-500K/year need professional quotes but
don't need (or want) complex software. They want to describe a job and get a PDF.

**Looking for feedback on**:
- Demo flow at /demo (try without signup)
- Is $9/mo positioned right for this market?
- Landing page - does it speak to blue-collar users?

**Stage**: Just launched, first users in trial, bootstrapped
```

### Post 3: r/Entrepreneur (Main Story Post)

**Title**: `I run a $30-50M contracting business. Built a quoting tool because everything else sucked.`

**Body**:
```
Not a success story. Just sharing what I'm building and why.

**Background**: I operate a contracting business that does $30-50M annually.
I've used every quoting tool out there - Jobber, Housecall Pro, Buildxact,
ServiceTitan. They all have the same problem:

They're either built for enterprise (complex setup, features you'll never use,
sales calls to get pricing) or they're basically spreadsheets with a logo.

**The gap I kept seeing**:

The solo contractor or small crew doing $50K-$500K/year. They need to look
professional to win jobs, but they don't need a $200/mo platform with CRM,
scheduling, invoicing, dispatch, and 47 other features.

They need to describe a job and get a PDF. That's it.

**What I built**:

Quoted.it.com - speak your estimate out loud (like you would to a helper),
and AI generates a professional PDF quote.

- Learns your pricing over time
- No complex setup
- $9/mo flat

**Where I'm at**:
- First users in trial
- Solo on the product side, still running my main business
- Just launched a demo where you can try it without signup

**What I've learned so far**:

1. Contractors don't want "AI" - they want less time doing paperwork
2. The "learning" feature (AI remembers your prices) resonates way more than I expected
3. Blue-collar users are skeptical of software. The demo-before-signup approach helps.

Building in public. Happy to answer questions about the tool or about running
a trades business.

### Post 4: r/startups (Share Your Startup Thread)

```
**Startup**: Quoted
**URL**: quoted.it.com
**Location**: [Your city]
**Pitch**: Voice-to-quote for contractors

**Founder background**: I run a $30-50M contracting business. Built this
because every quoting tool I tried was either enterprise-grade overkill
or a glorified spreadsheet.

**Target customer**: Solo contractors and small crews ($50K-$500K/year)
who need professional quotes but don't need complex software.

**How it works**: Speak your estimate naturally, AI generates a professional
PDF with learned pricing.

**Traction**: Just launched, first users in trial, pre-revenue
**Pricing**: $9/mo flat

**Ask**: Feedback on positioning. Is "voice-to-quote" clear enough, or
does it sound gimmicky?
```

## Trade Subreddit Strategy (Long Game)

**For r/HVAC, r/Electricians, r/Plumbing, r/Landscaping, r/Contractor**

These subreddits ban or heavily restrict self-promotion. The strategy is relationship-first:

### Timeline

| Week | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1-2 | Create account, lurk, upvote helpful content |
| 3-4 | Answer questions helpfully (NO product mention) |
| 5+ | When someone asks about quoting/estimating, share experience naturally |

### Example Helpful Comment (No Promotion)

When someone asks about quoting or estimating:

```
I've seen some guys use voice-to-text apps to speed this up. Record yourself
describing the job while walking through, then clean it up later. Beats trying
to type on a phone on-site.
```

### Example Natural Mention (Only When Directly Relevant)

Only use after weeks of helpful participation:

```
I actually helped build a tool for this - quoted.it.com. Happy to give you a
free trial if you want to try it. Full disclosure: I'm the founder.
```

## Cold Email Strategy

### Finding Contractor Emails (Ethical Sources)

| Source | Method | Volume Est. |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Google Maps** | Search "plumber near [city]", visit websites | 50-100/day manual |
| **Yelp Business Pages** | Email on public profiles | 30-50/day |
| **HomeAdvisor/Thumbtack** | Contractor profiles with contact info | Variable |
| **Facebook Business Pages** | Local trade groups, business pages | 20-30/day |
| **LinkedIn** | Search "plumber owner" + location | Slow but targeted |
| **Trade association directories** | PHCC, ACCA, NECA member lists | High quality |

### Email Compliance (CAN-SPAM)

- Include physical address
- Clear unsubscribe link
- Honest subject line (no "RE:" tricks)
- Identify as advertisement
- NEVER buy email lists

---

## Cold Email Templates

### Template 1: Operator Credibility (Primary)

**Subject**: `Built this after running a $30M+ contracting business`

```
Hey [First Name],

I run a $30-50M contracting business. After years of watching my team struggle
with quoting tools that are either way too complex or way too basic, I built
something in between.

Quoted.it.com - speak your estimate out loud, get a professional PDF in 60 seconds.

It learns your pricing over time. No enterprise setup. No sales calls.

30-second demo: https://quoted.it.com/demo

If you're tired of typing quotes on your phone or paying for software you
don't fully use, this might help.

Quoted.it.com

P.S. $9/mo. No contracts.
```

### Template 2: Direct Pain Point

**Subject**: `The quoting tool I wish existed 10 years ago`

```
Hey [First Name],

Quick question: how long do your quotes take?

I've run contracting businesses for years. The quoting process always bothered
me - either you're typing on your phone between jobs, or you're paying for
enterprise software with 50 features you don't need.

So I built something simple: speak your estimate out loud, get a professional
PDF. It learns your pricing over time.

Demo: quoted.it.com/demo

Worth a look?

- Eddie
```

### Template 3: Peer-to-Peer

**Subject**: `One operator to another`

```
Hey [First Name],

I run a $30-50M contracting business. I know how painful the quoting
process can be.

Built a tool that lets you speak your estimate and get a professional
PDF instantly. Learns your pricing. $9/mo.

Not trying to sell you enterprise software. Just something simple that works.

## What NOT to Do

1. **Don't post in r/Contractor** - explicitly bans ads
2. **Don't spam trade subreddits** - you'll get banned and hurt the brand
3. **Don't buy email lists** - low quality, damages deliverability
4. **Don't use clickbait subject lines** - "RE:" tricks destroy trust
5. **Don't oversell** - contractors are skeptical of software promises
6. **Don't hide that you're the founder** - transparency builds trust

---
