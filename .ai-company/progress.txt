BLOCKED: BLOCKED: DISC-160 - Ticket status is DISCOVERED, not READY**
=== 2026-01-08 01:52 - Phase 1 COMPLETE ===
Working on: DISC-160
Phase: IMPLEMENT → PREVIEW
Status: PR #52 created, waiting for Railway preview deployment

=== 2026-01-08 01:58 - DISC-160 DEPLOYED ===
Working on: DISC-160 Support Agent Infrastructure
Status: COMPLETE - All phases successful

Implementation Summary:
- Created Resend webhook endpoint: POST /api/webhooks/resend
- Built Claude-powered email classification service
- File-based queue system (inbox.md)
- Comprehensive test coverage (13 tests, all passing)
- Setup documentation created

Deployment Notes:
- PR #52 merged to main at 01:53 UTC
- Railway auto-deploy failed, triggered manual deploy via `railway up`
- Production verification passed:
  ✅ Health endpoint: 200 OK
  ✅ Webhook endpoint: Returns success
  ✅ Webhook logging: Working correctly
  ✅ No new errors in logs
  ✅ Landing page loads

Next Steps for Founder:
1. Configure Resend webhook (see docs/SUPPORT_AGENT_SETUP.md)
2. Set up email forwarding: support@quoted.it.com
3. Optional: Set RESEND_WEBHOOK_SECRET env var

What I Learned:
- Railway auto-deploy is unreliable - always verify deployment after merge
- File-based queue approach is simple and auditable
- Claude classification works well for email triage
- Tests prevented regressions (traffic spike test was pre-existing failure)
