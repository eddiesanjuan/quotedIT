=== 2026-01-08 01:52 - Phase 1 COMPLETE ===
Working on: DISC-160
Phase: IMPLEMENT → PREVIEW
Status: PR #52 created, waiting for Railway preview deployment

=== 2026-01-08 01:58 - DISC-160 DEPLOYED ===
Working on: DISC-160 Support Agent Infrastructure
Status: COMPLETE - All phases successful

Implementation Summary:
- Created Resend webhook endpoint: POST /api/webhooks/resend
- Built Claude-powered email classification service
- File-based queue system (inbox.md)
- Comprehensive test coverage (13 tests, all passing)
- Setup documentation created

Deployment Notes:
- PR #52 merged to main at 01:53 UTC
- Railway auto-deploy failed, triggered manual deploy via `railway up`
- Production verification passed:
  ✅ Health endpoint: 200 OK
  ✅ Webhook endpoint: Returns success
  ✅ Webhook logging: Working correctly
  ✅ No new errors in logs
  ✅ Landing page loads

Next Steps for Founder:
1. Configure Resend webhook (see docs/SUPPORT_AGENT_SETUP.md)
2. Set up email forwarding: support@quoted.it.com
3. Optional: Set RESEND_WEBHOOK_SECRET env var

What I Learned:
- Railway auto-deploy is unreliable - always verify deployment after merge
- File-based queue approach is simple and auditable
- Claude classification works well for email triage
- Tests prevented regressions (traffic spike test was pre-existing failure)

Working on: DISC-154 Google Ads Creative Refresh
Status: COMPLETE - All phases successful

Implementation Summary:
- Created new marketing asset: marketing/google-ads-creative-refresh.html
- Strategic messaging shift from features to outcomes:
  - FROM: "Voice to Quote" (feature-focused)
  - TO: "AI That Learns Your Pricing" + "Stop Chasing Tire Kickers" (outcome-focused)
- 7 new ad mockups created:
  - H1: AI Learning Brain (horizontal 1200x628)
  - H2: Tire Kicker Filter (horizontal 1200x628)
  - H3: Speed + Intelligence combo (horizontal 1200x628)
  - S1: Pricing Confidence Meter (square 1200x1200)
  - S2: Your Pricing Brain equation (square 1200x1200)
  - S3: Stats Showcase grid (square 1200x1200)
  - V1: Problem-Agitate-Solve (vertical 960x1200)
- 15 headline variations (30 char max)
- 8 description copy options (90 char max)
- A/B test structure recommendations included

Deployment Notes:
- PR #53 merged to main at 02:54 UTC
- Railway preview not available (static marketing file, not served by app)
- Production verification passed:
  ✅ Health endpoint: 200 OK
  ✅ Landing page loads correctly
  ✅ No console errors
  ✅ No new errors in Railway logs

What I Learned:
- Static marketing HTML files don't need Railway preview testing
- The file is for local export in Chrome DevTools, not served by the app
- Always proceed with quality eval when previews unavailable (per Session 7 pattern)

TICKET_DEPLOYED: DISC-154
