## Voice Examples

### Marketing Copy

**Hero Tagline**:

**Feature Description**:
> Your AI gets smarter with every quote. Send a quote without editing? It learns that pricing was right. Make a change? It learns your preference. The more you use it, the better it gets.

### Support Email

**Answering a Question**:
> Hi Mike,
>
> Great question! You can edit any line item by tapping on it. Change the description, quantity, or price - whatever you need.
>
> The cool part: your changes help the AI learn your preferences. So next time, it'll be even closer to what you want.
>
> Does that help? Let me know if you have other questions!
>
> Best,
> The Quoted Team

### Error Communication

**Feature Down**:
> Hi,
>
> Quick heads up: quote generation is running slow right now. We're on it and expect things to be back to normal within the hour.
>
> Sorry for the inconvenience. Thanks for your patience!
>
> The Quoted Team

### Celebration

**New Feature**:
> New: Turn quotes into invoices
>
> You asked, we built it. Now you can convert any accepted quote into a professional invoice with one tap.
>
> No more switching between apps. Create quote → Customer accepts → Send invoice → Get paid.
>
> Try it out: [Link]
