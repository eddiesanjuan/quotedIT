## Learnings & Insights

| Date | Learning | Source |
|------|----------|--------|
| 2024-12-01 | CountBricks and Buildxact are closest competitors. Neither has learning + voice combined. | Competitive research |
| 2024-12-01 | Contractors spend 70% of time in field. Mobile-first is critical. | Market research |
| 2024-12-01 | $50-150/month is market pricing for estimating tools | Competitive research |

---

## Strategic Context

**Why We Win**:
1. Voice-first matches how contractors actually work
2. Learning system gets more accurate over time (moat)
3. Speed: 30-second quotes vs 30-minute spreadsheets
4. No one owns "instant voice quote from job site" yet

**Risks**:
1. Buildxact could add voice
2. ServiceTitan could move downmarket
3. Contractors may resist new tools
4. Quote accuracy needs to be very high (>90%) or trust breaks

**Assumptions to Validate**:
1. Contractors will adopt voice input (vs typing)
2. Learning system creates meaningful accuracy improvement
3. $79-149/month price point works for solo contractors
4. Word-of-mouth will drive growth in tight contractor communities
