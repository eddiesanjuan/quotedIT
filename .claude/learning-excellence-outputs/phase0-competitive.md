# Phase 0: Competitive Intelligence

*Agent: comp-intel | Completed: 2025-12-24*

## Industry Approaches

| Competitor | Learning Approach | Strength | Weakness |
|---|---|---|---|
| **ServiceTitan** | Regional benchmarking via Titan Intelligence | Shows how prices compare to regional averages | Static regional data, no personalized optimization |
| **Jobber** | Template-based drafting from past quotes | Reduces manual entry | No pricing strategy optimization |
| **Housecall Pro** | AI price book management | Imports flat-rate pricing | Relies on users to manage pricing |
| **Thumbtack** | Competitive pricing visibility | Contractors see what competitors charge | Pure market comparison, no learning |
| **Contractor AI** | Construction-specific estimating | Trade-specific calculations | No adaptive learning |

## Gaps Quoted Can Exploit

1. **No one optimizes for contractor profitability** - Competitors show regional averages or past jobs, but none recommend pricing to maximize profit margin based on job characteristics

2. **No one learns from quote acceptance/rejection** - None analyze which quotes win vs. lose, then adjust pricing accordingly

3. **No one personalizes by contractor type** - All use generic benchmarks; none account for contractor reputation, brand positioning, or market niche

4. **Pricing isolated from outcome data** - None connect pricing strategy to actual project profitability

## Best Practices Worth Adopting

- **Jobber's draft-from-past-jobs approach** - Frame learning as "building on YOUR successful quotes"
- **ServiceTitan's regional benchmarking transparency** - Show how they compare to market
- **Housecall Pro's price book import flexibility** - Allow contractors to seed with existing pricing

## Strategic Recommendation

Position as "the only AI that learns from YOUR quote data to maximize YOUR profit." Rather than regional benchmarks (undifferentiated) or template drafting (table stakes), be transparent about analyzing each contractor's win rate, average job value, and margin by category—then recommend pricing adjustments that increase total profit, not just close rate.

## Category-Defining Opportunity

**"Pricing Intelligence for Contractors"** - Own the space where contractors finally understand which jobs to pursue at what price point. This is defensible because:
- Requires access to contractor's full quote history
- Requires transparency (contractors need to understand *why* Quoted recommends $X vs. $Y)
- No competitor offers this

## Key Insight

The market still treats pricing as **static data to be managed**, not a **dynamic optimization problem**. Quoted is uniquely positioned to make pricing learning the primary AI feature.
