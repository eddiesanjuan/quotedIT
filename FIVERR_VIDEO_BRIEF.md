# Fiverr Brief: Quoted App Demo Video

## Project Overview

I need a polished 60-90 second demo video for my app **Quoted** - a voice-to-quote tool for service professionals (freelancers, handymen, photographers, consultants, etc.).

The video should show the app being used on a phone, with nice device mockups and smooth transitions. No real people needed - just screen recordings in phone frames with music and text overlays.

**Website:** https://quoted.it.com (you can see the demo there)

## What I'll Provide

- Screen recordings of the app (I'll record myself using each feature)
- Logo and brand colors
- This brief with shot list
- Reference videos for the style I want

## Video Structure

**Total length:** 60-90 seconds

### Scene 1: The Problem (5-8 sec)
- Text overlay: "Quoting jobs takes forever..."
- Maybe: quick montage of frustration (spreadsheet, calculator, etc.) OR just text on clean background
- Transition to the solution

### Scene 2: Voice/Text Input (15-20 sec)
- Phone screen showing someone speaking or typing a job description
- Text appearing in real-time
- Show the quote being generated
- Clean phone mockup, maybe slight 3D angle

### Scene 3: Quote Output (10-15 sec)
- The generated quote with line items
- Tap to generate PDF
- Beautiful PDF preview appearing
- "Send" button → sent confirmation

### Scene 4: Learning System (10-15 sec)
- Show editing a price
- Toast notification: "Learned! Future quotes will be more accurate"
- Text overlay: "Gets smarter with every quote"

### Scene 5: Full System Quick Hits (15-20 sec)
- Quick cuts showing:
  - Customer list/CRM
  - Tasks and reminders
  - Converting quote to invoice
  - (I'll provide recordings of each)

### Scene 6: Call to Action (5-8 sec)
- Quoted logo
- "Try free - no signup required"
- Website: quoted.it.com

## Style & Vibe

**Feel:** Clean, modern, professional but warm. Not corporate or stiff.

**Phone mockups:** Realistic iPhone frame, can be 3D angled or flat. Clean background (gradient or solid).

**Transitions:** Smooth, snappy. Not cheesy or overdone.

**Text/Typography:** Modern sans-serif, minimal text on screen, let the app speak.

**Music:** Upbeat but not cheesy. Modern, clean production. I can provide or you can suggest.
